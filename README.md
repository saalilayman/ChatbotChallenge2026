# InnoWing Chatbot Challenge 2026

Materials for the InnoWing Chatbot Challenge — building a retrieval-augmented
(RAG) chatbot about the Tam Wing Fan Innovation Wing.

## 👉 Start here: [`submission_repo/`](submission_repo/)

**Your bot lives in [`submission_repo/`](submission_repo/).** That folder is the
scaffold you fork, build on, and submit. Everything else in this repository is
supporting material.

## Repository layout

| Path | What it is |
|---|---|
| [`submission_repo/`](submission_repo/) | **The submission scaffold — start here.** `main.py` + `bot/` + `build/`. This is what you fork and submit. |
| [`Labs/`](Labs/) | Workshop lab notebooks (`lab1`–`lab5`) with a sample corpus and prebuilt index for practice. Not your submission. |
| [`Slides/`](Slides/) | Workshop decks: W0 (setup & rules), W1 (RAG pipeline), W2 (visual & physical data). |

## Getting started

Requirements: Git, Python **3.9+**, and a code editor (VS Code recommended).

1. **Fork** this repository, then clone your fork.
2. Work inside [`submission_repo/`](submission_repo/):

   ```bash
   cd submission_repo
   python -m venv .venv
   # macOS & Linux:
   source .venv/bin/activate
   # Windows:
   .venv\Scripts\activate

   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Add your credentials:

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env   # then fill in your key
   python check_setup.py  # verify your setup before Workshop 1
   ```

4. Build your bot — edit `bot/answer.py` and the files under `build/`
   (`main.py`, `bot/llm.py`, `bot/store.py` are given), build your index, then run:

   ```bash
   python main.py "your question"
   ```

   That is the same command the grader uses.

## Workshops

Work through the notebooks in [`Labs/`](Labs/) alongside the decks in
[`Slides/`](Slides/). The labs are practice exercises and are **not** your
submission — see [`Labs/Notebook_Guide.md`](Labs/Notebook_Guide.md) for how they
map to the two workshops.
